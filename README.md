Welcome to the Student Management System, a simple yet efficient web application designed to manage student data. Built using Django, this application allows users to list students, add new students, and apply various filters.

Features

Student Listing: View student details like Full Name, Course, Gender, and Age. Options to update or delete records are included.
Filters: Filter students by Full Name, Course, Gender, and Age range.
Add Student: A form to add new students with fields for First Name, Last Name, Course, Gender, and Age.
Modern UI: Uses Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
